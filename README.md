# pigGame
A project exercise that utilizes HTML/CSS/Javascript. Basically a code along project but I mostly used the video for hints but I basically came up with the game logic in my own coding style.
Note that I only contributed on the logic (JS file). All HTML and CSS were provided by the course.
